    intro_text="Pull up a seat, pal. You’ve got a choice: tell the sober truth, or drink up. By the end
of the night, we’ll all be better friends after asking the questions we’ve never dared
to ask out loud. If anything, it’s worth a shot.

Shuffle the deck and take turns dealing. The dealer draws a
question card and assigns two fellow players to interview each
other. To start the round, hand either player the question card and
instruct them which question to ask.
After the first player answers or passes, the interviewees switch
positions and ask the remaining question.
Answer the question, or take a drink!


Drink and you forfeit your chance at winning the round, but you’ll get to guard
your secret forever. No booze? Just answer—the truth is also hard to swallow.
If both questions have been answered, the dealer judges which interviewee gave
the most satisfying answer, and awards that person the question card as a point.
(If you’re playing with alcohol, the loser takes a drink.)

Play continues clockwise—the next dealer draws a new question card, and picks
any two people to answer. We trust you to be a good sport; try not to ask one
person twice before everyone else has been asked once.


<b>this round’s on me cards:</b>

Everyone except the dealer must answer these questions. The dealer then judges
whose story is best and awards them the point. 

If you’re playing with alcohol, all
losing players must then take a drink.

3–4 players: The first to collect 5 question cards wins.
5–7 players: The first to collect 4 question cards wins.
8+ players: The first to collect 3 question cards wins.

The “With a Twist” deck squeezes a brisk squirt of additional
flavor into the game. Deal 3 Twist Cards to each player at the
start of the game. Players can use these cards to either redirect
an incoming question to a different person, or change something
about the question.

Multiple twist cards can be played in a single round! After each
round, draw more Twist Cards until you have three in your hand.
Can be played whenever you are asked a question.
Can be played at any time, even during someone else’s turn"
